# Renewable-Energy-Price-Modelling


## Overview

### This project focuses on forecasting renewable energy prices using a combination of linear and non-linear models. The models leverage historical renewable energy price data to make predictions, providing insights that can support decision-making in energy markets.

## Linear Models
### Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
### Unobserved Components Model (UCM)
## Non-Linear Models
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Data
### time_series_dataset.csv: The dataset containing historical energy price data, is used as input for model training and evaluation.
